I'm an 18 year old self-thaught Developer, mostly in Python and Javascript/Typescript but I also use with C#, C++, MongoDB and other Software including Adobe, Figma and Bootstrap Studio for Designs.
Most of my Repositories are 100% written by me including<br>
- [ ] [ATM (Python)](https://github.com/ItIzYe/atm)
- [ ] [MABuch (Python)](https://github.com/ItIzYe/MABuch)
<br>and others, where I have gotten help from other Devs as well like<br>
- [ ] [Drippy.JS (Javascript)](https://github.com/ItIzYe/Drippy.JS)

If you have projects I might work on, please just contact me, I'm happy to contribute to open-source
